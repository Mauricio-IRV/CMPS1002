[Black screen]
I-It wasn’t supposed to be like this.
 It was just a game.
[Flash of crime scene]
He can’t really be dead… right?
[Black screen]
— 1994 —
[???]
Huff... huff...
 Looks like I finally made it. Just a train, two buses, and a scenic hike through nowhere.
[Mansion – A girl’s sprite appears]
???
 “I don’t know why Rina picked her summer cabin of all places for a birthday party. Kind of a pain making everyone commute all the way out here. But I guess I’ll never understand rich people...”
[Door creaks open – Inside of mansion revealed]
???
 “Sora! Right on brand—last one here, as always.”
There she is—Rina. Once my quiet childhood friend, now a social butterfly who throws parties in the middle of the woods.
Sora
 “Oh yeah, thanks for the warm and totally not sarcastic welcome.”
Not much to say about me. Just your average high school girl who somehow got roped into this.
Rina
 “Come on, let me introduce you to everyone!”
She gestures toward a grumpy-looking girl who clearly didn’t want to be here.
Rina
 “This is Hana!”
Hana
 (arms crossed, unimpressed)
 “Nice to meet you. Rina talks about you all the time. I’ve even heard some of your bathtime stories.”
Sora
 “Wow. Fantastic. Just what I wanted to hear.”
Rina
 (grinning)
 “Oh, come on, you used to be so cute back then! Back when you weren’t such a buzzkill.”
If I knew this party was going to be a roast, I would’ve stayed home.
I shift my gaze to the corner of the room, where a studious-looking guy stands stiffly. Didn’t peg Rina for the type to date bookworms, but we haven’t talked in a year. Ever since she transferred to that fancy private school, we kind of… fell apart.
Rina
 “Oh! That’s Ken, our class president. If you’re ever in trouble, he’s the guy to go to.”
Sora
 “Noted.”
Standing next to him is… trouble. The kind of guy your parents warn you about.
???
 (smirks)
 “Hey there, sweetheart. You can just ask me out instead of staring.”
Ken
 (sighs, already exhausted)
 “Ren, for the love of everything decent, please stop harassing people.”
Ren (grinning, clearly not sorry)
 “What? It’s called charisma.”
Yeah. This is gonna be a long night.
Rina
 (hands on hips, teasing smirk)
“Oh, you boys. Behave, or I’ll feed you to the wolves. They’d be happy to eat a meathead like Ren.”
Ren
 (grinning)
 “Bold of you to assume they’d pick me first.”
Ken
 (sighs)
 “They would. No contest.”
Rina
 (ignoring them, turning to Sora)
 “Come on, let me show you to your room before you get sucked into their nonsense.”
Before I can protest, she grabs my arm and drags me up the grand staircase. For a place she calls a "log cabin," this place sure screams ‘inherited wealth’ more than ‘rustic getaway.’
At the very end of the hall, she stops and gestures.
Rina
“This one’s yours! Get comfy—dinner’s in 30 minutes, so take your time.”
The door clicks shut behind her, and I take a look around. Pretty plain. Not what I expected from a mansion, but at least it’s quiet.

“Wait a second, what’s this?”
A crumpled piece of paper peeks out from under the pillow.
[Crumpled Note Appears]
‘Don’t fall asleep in this room.’
“…Huh. That’s not at all concerning.”
I fold the note and tuck it away. Definitely showing this to Rina later.

[Weird Note has been added to your Inventory.]
 [Inventory Menu Appears.]
 (Press [Key] to open your inventory. Select an item to examine it closer.)
[Notes on the Paper]
— Slightly damp. Looks like it’s been here a while. No name. No answers.
Guess it’s time for dinner. Might as well head down.
As I step out, I collide with something—no, someone. A small girl, practically weightless, but the impact still catches me off guard.
At her feet, a torn piece of paper flutters to the ground. My breath catches.
It looks just like the one in my pocket.
Sora
“Oh, uh—are you okay?”
I offer her a hand, but she’s up in an instant, snatching the paper away like I just tried to steal state secrets.
Suspicious.
I know this girl. I’ve seen her in pictures with Rina before.
Sora (casual, but probing)
“You’re Ellie, right? What was that you just dropped?”
I try not to pry, but let’s be real—curiosity is practically in my DNA.
Ellie
 (visibly nervous, gripping the paper tight)
“Y-Yeah, that’s right. But it’s— it’s nothing! I-It’s not a-anything to do with you!”
And just like that, she bolts.
Sora
 (sighs)
“Yeah, okay. That wasn’t weird at all.”
Can I just have one normal day? Is that too much to ask?

I make my way downstairs, only to be joined by another girl descending beside me.
First impression? Loud.
 Second impression? Even louder.
She’s covered in makeup, radiating that particular brand of energy that makes me instantly tired.
???
 (grinning, arms crossed)
“Kyahaha! So I guess Rina just lets anyone off the street crash her parties, huh? Where do you go to school—St. Juliet’s School for the Poor?”
A real charmer, this one.
From the bottom of the stairs, Rina shoots her a glare.
Rina
 (deadpan, unimpressed)
“That’s an absolutely tasteless joke to make about my best friend, Tomo.”
Sora
 (shrugging, smirking)
“No, no, she’s got a point. They make us eat gruel every Tuesday. Sometimes they even let us work out in the yard.”
Tomo
 (horrified gasp)
“Wait— is this a school or a prison?!”
[INTERIOR: Dining Room]
Rina
 “Ta-da! Feast your eyes, peasants. Years of forced culinary training finally paying off.”
The food looked amazing. Say what you will about Rina, but when her parents made her take cooking classes, they created a monster—a monster that could absolutely out-chef any of us.
Ren
 “You know, I never thought a snooty chick like you could cook.”
Bits of food launch from his mouth with every word.
Ken (cringing)
 “…Has anyone ever told you that you eat like an actual wild beast?”
Ren (grinning
 “Yeah, my mom says that sometimes. Why?”
Ken (sighs)
 “Forget I asked.”
Rina
 "Not to interrupt your charming little bromance, but I had an idea to spice up the night a little."
I knew that tone. The "I'm about to make things weird" tone.
Rina (grinning)
 “How about a little ghost story?”
I barely resisted rolling my eyes. Not this again. She’d told me this story a hundred times as kids, and even now, she was still obsessed. Some things never change.
Before anyone could protest, she continued.
Rina (smirking)
 “Oh, and just so you all know—the buses won’t be running until noon tomorrow.”
Well. That’s ominous.
Ellie (fidgeting, nervous)
 “Uh… I-I don’t think this is a good idea—”
Tomo (grinning)
 “Shhh~! Let the lady tell her tale. If we’re gonna be trapped here, might as well get into the mood.”
Rina leaned in, lowering her voice, letting the firelight dance dramatically across her face.

[The Ghost Story of Blackwood Manor]
Rina
 “Now then… See, this place? It wasn’t always mine. It belonged to a family—the Blackwoods. And the last person who lived here? Died in this very house.”
The air in the room suddenly felt colder.
"A long time ago, back in the 1930s, Lady Margaret Blackwood inherited this mansion after her husband died. She lived here alone, after her only son mysteriously disappeared.
They say she never left.
Every night, she would lock herself in her bedroom, muttering under her breath. The servants would hear her talking to someone—but she was always alone.
Then, one night…
She vanished.
Her bedroom door? Locked from the inside.
 The windows? Bolted shut.
 No way in. No way out.
When the maids finally broke it down the next morning… she was gone.
The only thing left in the room?
A single note, scrawled in frantic handwriting:
"DON’T FALL ASLEEP. HE WATCHES FROM THE DARK."
Some say she was taken by a spirit—maybe even her lost son. Others believe she found a hidden passage and ran away.
But the creepy part?
Ever since that night, guests who sleep in her room report hearing whispers in the dark.
Some even claim to have seen a shadowy figure standing at the foot of the bed, watching them.
Waiting.
And those who fall asleep in that room?
They say…
They never wake up.”

Silence.
A tightness sat in my chest. I don’t remember that part of the story. But after the note I found in my room… it felt way too close to home.
Then, a snort. A small giggle.
Tomo
 “Pffft! You expect us to believe a load of baloney like that? What are we, a bunch of scared schoolkids?”
Haru (smirking)
 “I thought it was a fun story. Though I could have done without input from the rodeo clown over here.”
Tomo
 “Oh-ho! You’ve been giving me the stink eye all night, Haru. What, you wanna fight or something?”
Rina (exasperated)
 “Girls, please sto—”
Before she could even finish, a thunderclap shook the mansion.
A loud crack of lightning lit up the room for a brief second.
Everyone's heads whipped toward the window.
Outside, rain had started pouring, streaking down the glass in heavy sheets.
If I didn’t know any better… I’d think I just stepped into a horror novel.
Haru
 “…Sorry, Tomo. I know you were just trying to break the tension.”
Tomo (grinning)
 “S’alright. Not my fault I was born an entertainer.”
But something had shifted.
The mood felt off.
Even as the boys went back to trading jabs, even as we finished our meals, no one really knew what to say.
It became painfully clear that the only thing holding this group together was Rina.

[Interior: Living Room]
Rina glanced around at everyone, biting her lip.
Rina
 “Haha… This is getting kinda awkward, huh?”
I could tell she was feeling it too. The distance. The unease. This night wasn’t going the way she wanted.
Then, her eyes lit up. That dangerous look of hers.
Rina (grinning mischievously)
 “Okay, okay—how about we settle this ghost debate another way?”
She leaned forward, hands on the table.
Rina (grinning)
 “Why don’t we see if we can contact her?”
Tomo
 “Oh, hell yes! Now we’re talking!”
Ellie (nervous)
 “W-Wait, w-we don’t actually have to—”
Ken (adjusting his glasses, sighing)
 “Here we go…”
I just let out a deep breath.
Of course she’d suggest this.

[Scene: Ouija Board – All Characters Present]
[Visual: the board]
Rina (grinning like she’s been waiting her whole life for this)
 “All right, now that everything’s perfectly spooky, let’s try to summon our very special guest.”
She had gone all in: dimmed lights, wax-dripping candles, and a lace shawl over her shoulders like she was auditioning for Paranormal Housewives.
Hana (arms crossed, eyebrow raised)
 “Let me guess—we chant some gibberish, the lights flicker, and someone pretends to faint?”
Rina (holding up a scratched-up coin like it was the holy grail)
 “Nothing so dramatic. We just all place our fingers on this, focus, and call out to the dearly departed.”
Ken (adjusting his glasses, voice flat)
 “You know there’s no empirical support for any of this. It’s all based on ideomotor response and group suggestion.”
Tomo (grinning as she elbows him lightly)
 “Okay, Professor Buzzkill. Let us peasants enjoy our haunted circus.”
Ellie (already looking like she wants to be anywhere else)
 “A-Are we sure we should do this? This kind of stuff… it doesn’t feel right.”
Ren (leaning back with a smirk)
 “What, you think the ghost’s gonna reach out and strangle one of us? That’d be awesome.”
Sora (thinking)
 If we all make it through this night without punching Ren, it'll be a miracle.
Everyone slowly places their fingers on the coin. It’s cold—colder than it should be.
All eyes turn to Rina.
Rina (lowering her voice to a theatrical whisper)
 “We call upon the spirit of Lady Margaret Blackwood. If you are with us... give us a sign.”
Silence.
Then—
 The candles flutter as if someone breathed across them.
 A chill drifts through the room, cutting through the air like a knife.
No open windows. No drafts.
 Everyone tenses.
Ren (grinning but suddenly unsure)
 “Okay... that’s actually kind of freaky.”
Rina (completely committed)
 “Lady Blackwood, tell us what happened to you. We are listening.”
The coin trembles—then moves.
 Fast. Almost too fast.
 Letter by letter:
I… W… A… S… K… I… L… L… E… D.
The room is dead silent.
 Even Ren’s smirk has faded.
Ellie (whispers, voice breaking)
 “I… I really want to stop. Please. This isn’t fun anymore.”
Ren (trying to salvage the mood)
 “Aw, c’mon, don’t wimp out now! We just hit the creepy jackpot!”
Ellie (on the verge of tears)
 “No! That’s enough! We have to stop—please, stop!”
Her hands tremble. Her eyes are full of panic.
 She looks like she’s about to run and never look back.
Hana (firm, standing up)
 “All right, that’s it. We’re done.”
She strides over and flips the light switch.
The room is suddenly blinding—shadows gone, illusion shattered.
Tomo (stretching with a yawn)
 “Well, that was fun while it lasted. Guess the ghost had better things to do.”
Ken (shaking his head)
 “Or the ghost just doesn’t appreciate being misquoted.”
Sora (calmly, voice cutting through the awkward silence)
 “Okay. We’re all a little spooked and a lot tired. Maybe it’s best we call it a night?”
Rina (sighing dramatically)
 “Ughhh… I can’t believe I’m getting shut down by my own party. I was finally getting somewhere!”
No one replied.
 Everyone had already started drifting out—quiet, shaken, eyes avoiding the board.
Ren lingered by the doorway, glancing back.
 His voice, for once, was lower. Less cocky.
Ren
 “…You guys think someone was just pushing it, right?”
No one answered.
And when they were all gone, I stayed behind for a second.
 The board sat still.
 The candles flickered softly, as if breathing.
And the cold…
 The cold hadn’t left.
[Scene: Guest Bedroom – Night]
Lying in bed, my thoughts refused to settle.
The board. The flickering candles.
 The cold that hadn’t left.
Where had that wind come from?
 Why did it feel like something had actually been there?
I told myself it was just drama. Just nerves.
 But my body didn’t believe me.
Eventually, my eyes grew heavy, and sleep started to pull me under—

…
 …

[??? – A Scream Pierces the Night]
???
 “AAAAAAAAAAAAA—!”
My eyes snapped open.
I sat up in bed, heart slamming against my ribs.
 No time to change—my hoodie was half on, socks mismatched, but I was already out the door and into the hallway.
There, huddled on the ground, was Ellie, pointing at a door with wide, terrified eyes.
Something red was smeared across the wood in thick, dripping lines.
Paint.
 The smell hit me first—sharp and synthetic.
Still wet.
 Whoever did this was here just moments ago.
Sora
 “Ellie—did you see who did this?”
Ellie (shaking, barely holding it together)
 “N-No… I-I was just going to the bathroom… and then I—I saw—”
Her voice cracked, her finger trembling as she kept pointing.
I stepped up to the door and jiggled the handle. Locked.
Whose room was this?
I knocked.
Sora
 “Hey, can you come out for a sec? Something really weird’s going on out here.”
Silence.
No footsteps. No voice.
 Nothing.
Which was odd, considering Ellie had screamed bloody murder loud enough to wake the dead.
Footsteps pounded down the hall—
 The others were finally arriving.
Ken (deadpan, rubbing his temples)
 “Seriously? Are we doing a haunted house bit now? We’re in high school. Try to act like it.”
Tomo (storming in with a scowl)
 “Who the heck is interrupting my beauty sleep—”
She stopped mid-sentence, catching sight of the red door.
 Her face was bare without makeup. Honestly, I barely recognized her.
Rina (eyes narrowing as she looked at the door)
 “Wait… isn’t that Ren’s room?”
A chill crept down my spine.
Sora
 “Yeah. And he’s not answering. The door’s locked.”
Rina (already turning on her heel)
 “There’s a master key downstairs. I’ll grab it!”
She bolted.
Ellie sat on the floor, hugging her knees and crying quietly while the rest of us stood there in tense silence, whispering in uneasy tones.
Seconds crawled by.
 Then—
Rina (returning, a bit breathless)
 “Got it! Sorry, it took a second—it wasn’t in the drawer I thought it was.”
 She held up a gleaming key.
 “Alright… let’s see what the prankster’s hiding.”
She slid the key into the lock.
 Turned it.
Click.
And right then—
 A horrible chill ran through me.
 Familiar. Dreadful.
 Like I’d been here before.
And as the door creaked open—
My worst fears stepped out to greet me.

[Inside Ren’s Room]
He was there.
Ren.
Slumped on the floor, his back awkwardly propped against the edge of the bed.
 One hand limp in his lap.
Eyes wide open.
 Staring at nothing.
I rushed to him—
 Grabbed his shoulders—
Sora
 “Ren? Hey—wake up!”
I shook him once.
 Twice.
His skin was cold.
 Not just chilly.
Cold.
And then I knew.
 Without needing to check his pulse.
 Without needing to say it out loud.
Ren was dead.
And someone in this house did it.

There’s no way the police will make it to us before the killer escapes with the storm the way it is.
I have to investigate
[scene, investigation]
Clue 1: Lock Mechanism Scratches
[Click: Interior side of the door lock]
 Sora:
 “These are… scratches? Tiny and shallow—right above the locking bolt.”
 Looks like someone forced the lock to turn. From the outside. But how?
Clue 2: Thin Line Stuck in the Doorframe
[Click: Bottom corner of the doorframe / under the door]
 Sora:
 “There’s a thread caught down here…” (pulls gently)
 “…No, not thread—fishing line? And it’s frayed at the end…”
 Looks like it snapped under pressure. But what was it being used for?
Clue 3: Red Paint Smudge on Door Handle (Inside)
[Click: Interior door handle]
 Sora:
 “…There’s a red smear on the inside of the handle. It’s not blood… it’s paint.”
 Exactly the same shade as what was smeared on the outside. Whoever painted the door… touched this.
Clue 4: Something Under the Bed – A Broken Garrote
[Click: Under the bed, near Ren’s body]
 Sora:
 “What is this…?” (reaches and pulls out a broken loop of thin wire)
 “It’s stiff—almost like a noose. One side’s twisted, and the loop is… shaped like a neck.”
 This isn’t rope. This is a homemade garrote.
Clue 5: Faint Bruising on Neck (Post-Mortem Body Inspection)
[Click: Ren’s body, focus on neck]
 Sora:
 “There’s barely visible marks… like thin red lines circling his neck. Too faint for rope…”
 “…but a wire would leave marks just like this. It wouldn’t take much to cut off airflow.”
Other locations scenes:

Dining Room 
Tomo (holding a cup of cold tea, unimpressed)
 “Okay but like, why would anyone use paint? That whole ‘bloody door’ thing was so extra.”
Ken (adjusting glasses)
 “Red paint doesn’t dry instantly. Someone did it right before the scream, otherwise it would’ve been tacky or dry. Which means they were right outside the room.”
Tomo
 “…Wait, so wouldn’t Ren have heard someone painting his door?”
Ken
 “Exactly. Assuming he was alive at the time.”
Location: Séance Room (Earlier Séance Scene)
Ken (during the séance setup)
 “You know, if you wanted to create a perfect ghost hoax, all you’d need is some monofilament line and a decent knowledge of physics.”
Hana (quietly, almost too knowing)
 “…Fishing line’s basically invisible under candlelight.”
Ren (laughing)
 “Man, you sound like you’ve done this before.”
Hana (shrugs)
 “Some tricks are just common sense if you’re not an idiot.”
Location: Guest Room (Sora’s Room)
Sora (examining the old art supplies on the desk)
 “Hey, didn’t you use this paint set for that dumb portrait of Tomo last year?”
Rina (laughing)
 “Oh god, yeah. She made me repaint her eyelashes three times. Why?”
Sora
 “This red paint—it’s the same one on the door. Was this always in here?”
Rina
 “No, I brought it out before dinner. I was gonna use it for a prank later but I never got the chance. Wait… someone must’ve taken it from this room.”
Final Deduction Moment (Player Dialogue Example)
Sora (inner monologue):
 “The door was locked from the outside… using fishing line. That explains the broken thread caught beneath the frame. The killer painted the door, closed it, then used the wire to pull the handle and engage the lock.
That’s why there’s paint on the inside handle—Ren couldn’t have done that from the outside. And the murder weapon? A garrote—thin wire, like the one under the bed.
This wasn’t supernatural. This was cold, planned… and personal.”
[Final Confrontation – Living Room, Night]
The storm outside hadn’t let up. Rain still lashed the windows, and the thunder was getting comfortable.
We sat in a semi-circle around the fireplace. No one said much. We were tired. Shell-shocked.
 But I couldn’t let this night end with a ghost story.
Too much didn’t add up.
 And the truth? It was in the room with us.

Rina (wringing her hands)
 “So… if it wasn’t a ghost, or a prank gone wrong…”
I stood up.
Sora (narration):
 I’d walked through Ren’s room, retraced someone else’s steps.
 There were no spirits—only secrets. And one of them was about to snap.
Sora
 “It wasn’t an accident. And it wasn’t supernatural.”
 “Ren was murdered. By someone in this house.”
Tomo (raising a brow)
 “Oh come on—murder? Really?”
Ken (coldly)
 “She’s right. Door was locked. Windows sealed. He didn’t do this to himself.”
Ellie (shaking slightly)
 “B-But it was painted… like the story. The ghost…”
Sora (narration):
 That was the point. Someone wanted us to believe it.
Sora
 “The red paint was fresh. Still wet when Ellie found it. Which means Ren was already dead when it was put there.”
 “But there’s more—look closely at the door.”

[Select correct clue]
I held up the frayed thread of fishing line I found under the frame.
Sora
 “This was jammed under the door. Fishing line—thin enough to go unnoticed. Strong enough to pull the lock shut from the outside.”

 It was clever. I’ll give them that. But clever plans fall apart under the weight of detail.
Sora
 “Whoever killed Ren locked the door after leaving. Painted the scene. Pulled the handle shut using this line, then snapped it off and walked away.”
Ken
 “Which means… it had to be someone who knew how to stage it.”
Tomo
 “Okay, but why? Ren was annoying, sure, but not—murder-worthy!”
Sora (narration):
 And this is where it got personal.
 Because I’d seen it in her eyes. Not panic. Not fear.
 Resolution.
I turned to her.

[SELECT THE CULPRIT]

-if selected the wrong person, dialogue is
Sora
I don’t think that’s right, lets try this again-
Sora
 “Hana.”
Everyone looked at her. She didn’t flinch.
Sora
 “You knew how fishing line works. You were calm. Too calm. And when I found the murder weapon under the bed—wire fashioned into a garrote—I knew it wasn’t some spur-of-the-moment act.”
 “You planned this.”
Hana (quietly)
 “…So what if I did?”
Sora (narration):
 The words landed like a slap.
 Even now, she wasn’t scared.
Hana
 “He wasn’t just some punk. He ruined my brother’s life. Treated it like a joke. I waited for someone to do something.
 No one ever did.”
Rina (shocked)
 “Hana, you could’ve told us—”
Hana
 “And you would’ve what? Believed me? Told me to let it go?
 I did what I had to.”
Sora (narration):
 I could see it on her face—
 No guilt. Just… relief.
 Like she’d finally exhaled after holding her breath for years.

Sora
 “The police are on their way.”
 “You’ll have to explain the rest to them.”
Hana
 “Let them come.”
Sora (narration):
 And that was it. The end of the séance.
 Only this ghost had a name. And a motive.

[Post-Scene – Hallway, Later That Night]
Everyone had gone to bed, or at least tried.
 Rina sat quietly by the fire. Ken was making calls. Tomo had actually offered Ellie tea—first kind thing she’d done all weekend.
I lingered in the hallway, outside Ren’s room.
There was something still stuck in my chest. Like the story wasn’t finished.
That’s when I saw it—beneath the baseboard.
A scrap of paper.
[Item Collected: Crumpled Note 2]
Same handwriting as the first one I found under my pillow.
 Jagged. Uneven. Like it was written in a rush.
“He wasn’t the only one.
 The others will pay too.”
Sora (narration):
 My blood ran cold.
Who wrote this? Hana?
 Or someone else still hiding in this house?
Whatever it was…
 This wasn’t over.
Not even close.
